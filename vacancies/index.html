  </li>
</ul>

<!-- The research work will center on **computational imaging, particularly image reconstruction and analytics**. You can check the [publications](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/pub.html) of the group for some general impression of what we do here. -->

<p>To apply, you need to have a bachelorâ€™s degree in electrical and electronic engineering, or equivalent (such as mathematics). A Master degree would be a plus for PhD applicants. You should apply directly to the University through the <a href="https://www.hku.hk/gradsch">Graduate School</a>, but if you are interested in working in the above areas, you should put Prof. Edmund Y. Lam as the <strong>proposed supervisor</strong> and <strong>computational imaging</strong> as the proposed study area.</p>
