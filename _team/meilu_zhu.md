## Bio
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Imaging Systems Laboratory](https://isl.eee.hku.hk/) from the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the University of Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Edmund Y. Lam](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/pub.html). I obtained my Ph.D. from City University of Hong Kong in August 2025. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, where I develop intelligent systems to address critical medical challenges. I am always eager to explore potential research collaborations and welcome you to reach out if my work aligns with your interests.
