From August 10-14, 2025, the 16th International Conference on Information Optics and Photonics (CIOP 2025) was held in Xi'an, China. Prof. Edmund Lam of the University of Hong Kong's Imaging System Laboratory (ISL) delivered an invited talk in the SC11. Optical Imaging, Display and Storage section, focusing on "Advanced Deep Learning in Digital Holography" â€” a key ISL research area.

Prof. Lam's presentation, on August 12, covered digital holography basics and the lab's prior work in end-to-end deep learning for both low-level tasks (amplitude/phase retrieval) and high-level tasks (classification, particle tracking). He addressed critical issues in deep learning-aided digital holography, including data scarcity and model interpretability, then outlined ISL's solutions: transfer learning, generative priors, and physics-integrated networks, citing relevant lab publications.

This talk showcased ISL's advancements at the intersection of deep learning and digital holography, fostering academic exchanges in the field.
