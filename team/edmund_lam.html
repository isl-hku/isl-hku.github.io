<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Edmund Y. Lam received the B.S. degree (with distinction) in 1995, the M.S. degree in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in 2000, all in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He was the 49th Ph.D. graduate of Prof. Joseph W. Goodman.</p>

<p>At Stanford, he conducted research for the Programmable Digital Camera project in the Information Systems Laboratory. He also consulted for industry in the areas of digital camera systems design and algorithms development. After brief stints in Silicon Valley start-ups, he joined the Reticle and Photomask Inspection Division (RAPID) of KLA-Tencor Corporation in San Jose, CA, as a senior imaging engineer. He was primarily involved in the design of defect detection tools for the core die-to-die and die-to-database inspections. The product received a Semiconductor International Editor’s Choice Best Product Award, in addition to capturing a substantial market share.</p>

<p>He is now a Professor in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Professor in Computer Science (by courtesy), Associate Head (Research and Innovation), Director of the Computer Engineering program, and the founding director of the Imaging Systems Laboratory at the University of Hong Kong. A recipient of the IBM Faculty Award, he is also a Fellow of Optica (formerly OSA), the Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&amp;T), the Institute of Physics (IOP), as well as the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE).</p>

<p>During the 2010–11 academic year, he was invited to teach at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Visiting Associate Professor.</p>

<p>He has broad research interests around the theme of computational optics and imaging, from algorithms design to applications. For his research work, he was presented the Outstanding Young Researcher Award of the University of Hong Kong in 2008, being the only recipient in engineering, and the Outstanding Researcher Award in 2019. With regards to teaching, he has taught at all levels of the departmental courses, and devoted considerable efforts in reshaping the first course in the electrical and electronic engineering curriculum. He was given an engineering Best Teacher Award in 2011, and the university-wide Outstanding Teaching Award (team award) in 2012, and an engineering Outstanding Teaching Award (team award)] in 2019.</p>

<p>Besides his involvement within the university, he is also active in professional organizations. He was the Chair of the OSA Image Sensing and Pattern Recognition Technical Group. In addition, he has served two terms as a topical editor of the Journal of the Optical Society of America A; currently, he is an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, and a senior area editor of the IEEE Signal Processing Letters. He has also been active in conference organizations, serving as committee or chair of several conferences over the years. These include OSA’s Signal Recovery and Synthesis and Computational Optical Sensing and Imaging meetings, the IS&amp;T / SPIE conference on Image Processing: Machine Vision Applications, the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras, and the IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques.</p>

<p>To date, he has published over 400 articles, and graduated more than 30 students. A couple of his papers were given best paper awards, including the First ASML/Cymer Best Student Paper Award in the SPIE Lithography Asia conference and the best paper award in the IEEE International Conference of Advanced Learning Technologies. One of his papers on digital holography was selected among the 10 ‘‘Editor’s Picks’’ in the 50th anniversary of Applied Optics that reflect the progression in this area over the journal’s history.</p>
