## Graduate Student
<!-- Opportunities to work on **computational imaging, image reconstruction, and analytics**, with scholarships and fellowships available (HKPFS, Presidential PhD, PGS).   -->

Both Master and PhD applicants are welcome. International students are particularly invited to apply. 

The university offers opportunities with attractive packages, with **generous stipend for 4 years of study**:

- [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html)

- [HKU Presidential PhD Scholarship](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#1)

- [Postgraduate Scholarship](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#4)

<!-- The research work will center on **computational imaging, particularly image reconstruction and analytics**. You can check the [publications](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/pub.html) of the group for some general impression of what we do here. -->

To apply, you need to have a bachelor's degree in electrical and electronic engineering, or equivalent (such as mathematics). A Master degree would be a plus for PhD applicants. You should apply directly to the University through the [Graduate School](https://www.hku.hk/gradsch), but if you are interested in working in the above areas, you should put Prof. Edmund Y. Lam as the **proposed supervisor** and **computational imaging** as the proposed study area.



For further details or to apply, please contact **Prof. Edmund Lam** (elam @ eee.hku.hk).
